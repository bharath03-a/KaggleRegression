Regression tasks are fundamental in machine learning and involve predicting continuous values, such as car prices, house prices, or sales. This repository aggregates structured solutions, featuring **EDA**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation techniques**.

Each competition folder includes:
- Cleaned datasets.
- Notebooks detailing the workflow.
- Final predictions and insights for leaderboard performance.
